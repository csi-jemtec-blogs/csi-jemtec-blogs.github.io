         <!-- <p class="font1">In todayâ€™s world, we as a human race are facing a crisis that seems to repeat itself as rare as once every  100 years.It has been about a year and a half Since then we've come a really long way, from taking this condition lightly to researching it and knowing about it to taking the consequences of slacking seriously.<br>
            There are a lot of resources and helping hands that have been used. One such helping hand is Artificial Intelligence
            </p> -->
         <p class="font1">Studies and students, some truly inseparable entities, we know how this relation has been since the start of time. Learning and studying have been probably one of the few things which have been constant throughout the history of mankind. Although, there have been changes and modifications, some good, some bad, some positive, some negative, but in all the core of studies today all over the world remains learning.  
            Let us go through a journey of this vivid process of learning and learn how learning developed and where it led toâ€¦
            
        </p>
        <h4> Past of Learning </h4>
         <p class="font1">We know since beginning learning started from a very rooted core subject philosophy because scholars then used to think a lot about the world and worldly things as well. Talking about the process there used to be a well established teacher-student relationship where we have witnessed great philosophers and teachers like Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, Archimedes etc.
            These were some middle eastern and European influences, if we take a detour to Indian culture, we get a perfect example of what a perfect teaching culture looked like.
            
            </p>
         <p class="font1">There is an easy eThere used to be students who left their houses and lived with their Gurus to gain knowledge from them and used to be with them for years. After they graduated it was their glories gained by learning and knowledge which became their teacherâ€™s payment in return. This was our glorious past of studies and learning and as we move on we see the history of colonization and studying took a turn, and education became much more controlled and censored, in a way where everything came under the government of what the students will learn and whatnot. 
        </p>
         <p class="font1">Now in the whole world, the education system is again getting more liberal slowly and steadily, some countries are already there while some countries like India are still on their way to change.
        </p>
            <h4>Present-day scenario </h4>
        <p class="font1">
            Today the scenario is a bit different, today the whole world is inside closed doors and early on when these conditions kicked in, no one knew how long it would take for this disease to go away and hence the studies went into a cold strongbox for a small-time, but soon we came to know we can't just ignore studies. Irrespective of how long this goes, we have to continue educating and teaching students for the future. 
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            Answers came to us as online lectures and classes to transfer the knowledge in the most ancient way possible that is via voice and visuals.
        </p>
            <h4> Online Education </h4>
        <p class="font1">
            Although we started video lectures it has its goods and bad.
            Yes if we were to ask students, no doubt they would love the way it is going as what better way to skip and bunk classes without having attendance issues, come on what better way to sneak out those extra hours of sleep in those chilly mornings if you were to ask me, I am all up for it but jokes aside, really this new study system which came out as a result of forced necessity has hampered education in some way, let's see how 
            
        </p>
        <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <li>
                Pursuing online education generally takes off practicality from education, which must always be the centre stone for learning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Online education poses some technical difficulties for some students and makes the transfer of knowledge even more difficult.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sometimes it becomes necessary for teachers to be physically present for students, especially young primary school kids to inculcate discipline into them, which is somehow compromised in the online mode of education.
            </li>
            <li>
                We know everyone has a right to education but, some lower economic strata of society who cannot afford that tech support to continue education take a large hit without any reason.
            </li>
          </ol>
        <p class="font1">
            However, sometimes we overlook how online education has enabled the students to learn new things as well.
We overlook how starting online education has been sustainable for the environment as well, how less use of electricity and modes of transport contributed to lack of pollution. 
Anyways this is something which is a very indirect advantage, also now students who were shy enough to participate in the class physically can interact a bit more and learn better.
We all know how learning or understanding by photos is way more efficient, and by implementing this form of education we made sure that photographic learning was inculcated into kids and when asked students did learn and remember the concepts in a much better way.

        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            If we see the future of this kind of education, it is a dilemma, to be honest as nothing can be classified as black or white everything is a shade of grey. If we move into the future with this format we must make a mind map to where this form of education would suit, and where practicality is the demand. For example, if we were to teach a student who is ardent to learn and can afford the loss of practicality like a commerce student or a computer science student, it becomes a very good option for them, but on the contrary, if we start teaching a student who is not that into learning, then online lectures just become a way to escape education for them, or even for students like medical students or mechanical engineers or students who have practicality centred education it is not a good choice moving forward in future. We don't want a doctor diagnosing us or treating us who doesn't know the practical skills of handling medical instruments, right? 
            Now it's just a matter of choice we cannot implement anything and everything just blindly, we have to segregate and categorize before we start to see this as a permanent form of education because this could change education for good as well as for bad.
            
        </p>
    
            <h4 style="text-align: center;"> The Choice is Ours </h4>
