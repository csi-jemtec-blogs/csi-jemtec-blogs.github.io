            Privacy nowadays has become much more of a concern than it was earlier. Now it has become a matter of security. Teenagers usually ask their parents for some space or some freedom and term it as their privacy. It‚Äôs not like they are hiding something from their parents, it‚Äôs just that there are few things that we want to keep personal to ourselves and do not want to share with anyone. Just like that is our data security and privacy over the internet which includes very confidential information and cannot be shared with anyone so easily.

            As there is an advancement in the antivirus systems and other protective measures to control the cyber attacks, there is also an increase in the number of perpetrators who are constantly trying to peek into other‚Äôs systems. Due to these malicious activities most of the people, the middle class to be more specific are afraid of doing online transactions. They do not want to shift towards digitalisation and still believe more in cash payments. This is a major barrier to the advancement and progress of the country. A survey conducted revealed that nearly 74 per cent of the citizens were concerned about the cyber risks, 78 percent were worried about the financial data being stolen such as debit card, credit card details and 20 percent of the respondents were not confident in their ability to prevent a cyber attack.

             Usually, we come across news about the hacking of ids on Instagram or Facebook by merely just clicking on a random link. There are also many cases of fraudulent money transactions from bank accounts. The idea is that we still don‚Äôt have the proper technological infrastructure that is prone to all these hostile activities. The public open wifi is so insecure that it can easily corrupt our systems. Cyber Crimes occur in different forms like sometimes these involve politically motivated information gathering, sometimes it‚Äôs a terrorist group that only wants to create fear and panic amongst the public, and many times it‚Äôs a group of people or individuals targeting the financial credentials to cause disruption. Like there are microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi which when entered into a human body infects it severely, similarly, there are few malware which when entered into a computer system, corrupts it acutely. Virus, Trojans, Spyware, ransomware, botnet, adware are some of the examples of this malware Adware is the advertising software that can be used to spread malware while botnets are the networks of malware-infected computers which cybercriminals use to perform tasks online without the user‚Äôs permission.

            Well, every problem has its solution also. Closely we can guard our data and personal information against cybercrimes using some of the effective protective measures. Here are some of the safety tips:
  <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>
          Update the software and operating systems timely.
      </li>
      <li>
          Use strong antivirus software.
      </li>
      <li>
          Ensure that the passwords are quite strong and avoid the use of similar passwords for most of the ids.
      </li>
      <li>
          Do not open the links in the emails from unknown senders.
      </li>
      <li>
          Avoid using unsecured wifi networks in public areas.
      </li>
  </ul>

            A short time ago, the owner of reliance industries, Mukesh Ambani said that ‚Äúdata is the new oil‚Äù which means that a country's data should be held and monitored by its citizens only and not by corporations, especially global MNC‚Äôs. He stressed the protection of data and its security as a very large amount of data is generated over the internet and other social media platforms daily. The remark came amid a raging debate in the country over whether data of Indians are safe with foreign companies or not. Countering the statement, Facebook said that to contain data within geographical boundaries and restricting its flow outside the country would be to "turn this great ocean of innovation into a still lake." Clegg, the Vice‚ÄëPresident for Global Affairs and Communications at Facebook, Inc. emphasized that data is not the new oil and countries like India should allow its free flow across borders instead of attempting to hoard it as a finite commodity within national boundaries. The question that comes to our minds after having an eye on all these statements is that is our data safe?

            But the good news is that India recently jumped from the 47th rank to the 10th in the cybersecurity index. That means over a period of time more evolution of technology would thrive out and we would be more carefree.
