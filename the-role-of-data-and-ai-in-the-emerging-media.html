            The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the news reporting process could help future magazine publishers and newsrooms work more efficiently. AI platforms can be used to help journalists fact-check in real-time and generate automated news coverage. Journalism is also benefiting from AI technology since it largely involves gathering and analyzing datasets to determine if a story exists. The trend is a lot more mainstream than one might think.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            In March 2018, it was reported that Reuters was building a tool aimed at helping journalists analyze data and suggest story ideas. That product, Lynx Insight, has since been rolled out to newsrooms across the globe. Magazines are also starting to embrace the AI for data journalism model.
            
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            Yet those interested in becoming reporters should know that, while AI can assist with content creation, it cannot substitute for human reporting. For example, Reuters‚Äô Lynx Insight does not replace reporters but instead is designed to sort through data to spot patterns and allow human staff to ask questions and understand the context.
            Human journalists are skilled in developing relationships with sources, providing in-depth analysis of data, and determining whether a given topic is newsworthy ‚Äî all of which AI simply cannot do.
            
         </p>
         <p class="font1">
            Advancement of technology has been taking place since the 20th century with the research and deep study of the photoelectric effect, quantum mechanics and lead to the development of quantum and supercomputers. There were many paradigms in its development over the years. Computers, mobile phones, television, watches, and calculators came into existence. But the major revolution came with the discovery and invention of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and machine learning. Now the question arises what artificial intelligence is? Have you ever wondered why your YouTube feed or Instagram feed is full of the same kind of videos you saw a day before? Or why your Google suggests the similar kind of stories or news to read in which you have the interest? This is all because of artificial intelligence(AI) and machine learning. It is a tool that is capable of performing human-like tasks or even better. It includes speech recognition, face recognition, cloud computing, quantum computing, etc. For example the Amazon Alexa we use nowadays in our homes is the best example of AI. The autocorrect feature in mobile phones or the ones suggesting appropriate emojis, stickers, and GIFS are all part of this new technology. Forbes has rolled out an AI-powered Content Management System called Bertie that suggests content and titles, The Washington Post released Heliograf that can generate the entire articles from quantitative data, Bloomberg is using Cyborg for content creation and management. AI has been designed and enhanced in such a way that it can imitate human cognitive abilities. The advent of AI has made our lives easier and convenient.  Still, there‚Äôs a lot more to know and understand about data structures and machine learning, and what has been discovered till today can be summarized as ‚ÄúThe fun has just begun‚Äù.
         </p>
         <p class="font1">
            Now as someone has rightly said that the same coin has two different sides, so it is. Everything in this world has its advantages as well as disadvantages. Similarly, AI is not only a boon to our society but it could soon turn out to be a bane also. A very renowned scientist and physicist Stephen Hawking once said in his interview that-‚ÄúAI could be the 'worst event' in human civilization‚Äù. He feared that it could replace the human race itself. He thought that if people design computer viruses, someone will design AI that improves and replicates itself. This will be a new form of life that outperforms humans. Artificial intelligence stepped into the gaming world in the 1950s and has been an integral part of it since then. It has opened the doors of a new whole world for the programmers to innovate ideas and build up to something unimaginative. However, many video game developers are hesitant to build advanced AI into their games in fear of losing control of the overall player experience. Remember a famous movie by film star  Shahrukh Khan, the RaOne? The concept of AI was also used to create an adventurous sci-fi movie. But we saw that the invincible character created by the developer soon enters into the real world, takes control of everything, and kills the developer itself. So if it‚Äôs not used wisely then it can end up into something very dangerous about which no one could have ever thought of.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            The role of data science and AI has played a vital role in newspapers, magazines, and other media outlets. It has helped journalists, news reports, news websites, and even the audience in a greater sense. Now the news shown is effective, entertaining, with eye-catchy salient features. This new system has given a wide range of opportunities to an individual such as doing editing, teaching, book writing, copywriting, and showing their creative skills. Many news reporters and activists are moving to social media platforms for better communication with the audience. Now they are becoming self-independent and opening their pages. Through this medium, it no longer remains one-one communication but has enabled the reporters to connect with the people and listen to their views also. They understand the criticism and aggression of the public and spread forward. This fulfils the soul motive of spreading news.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            As we know through AI and machine learning, we can easily see news of our interests only, this greatly helps in saving our time. The suggestions given by this feature according to our areas of interest enable us to acquire more new knowledge and see what‚Äôs happening around the world.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            The next fantastic task it has played is in the Advertising world. As people are now shifting more towards reading online rather than from newspapers, the companies took this opportunity to promote their stuff around there. People spend hours scrolling down these various sites, so the MNC‚Äôs started advertising their products on these websites as they are eye-catching and deep details of the product can be known in a lesser amount of time.        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            In today‚Äôs world, much fake news is always floating around here which sometimes creates a lot of aggression amongst the people. Filtering this fake information is very necessary else it can result in catastrophic situations. AI will do this amazing work also. It will help in the refining of the fake comments, news, and ids that are no longer acceptable.AI has changed the whole face of journalism and will continue to change the way the news is generated, produced, published, and shared.
