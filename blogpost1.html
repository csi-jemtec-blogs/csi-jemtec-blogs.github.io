         <p class="font1">In today‚Äôs world, we as a human race are facing a crisis that seems to repeat itself as rare as once every  100 years. Here we are talking about the Pandemic, ‚Äúdisease prevalent over a whole country or the world‚Äù. We are amidst a situation where we are so vulnerable that even a small mishap or a small carelessness can cost us severely.<br>
            It has been about a year and a half since the first time we heard of this deadly virus and name COVID-19, it was first found in December 2019 in Wuhan province of China. Since then we've come a really long way, from taking this condition lightly to researching it and knowing about it to taking the consequences of slacking seriously. There are a lot of resources and helping hands that have been used.
            </p>
         <p class="font1">One such helping hand is Artificial Intelligence. Although the opinions about this wondrous technology being useful are debatable but still the paramount role it has played in this time of need is undeniable.<br>
            Artificial intelligence has its way of learning things via an algorithm, all depending on what data is fed to it.
            </p>
         <p class="font1">There is an easy example to understand how AI works. Let‚Äôs imagine, there is an all-knowing box, and it answers our question depending on what kind of information we give to it. We could enter ‚Äòn‚Äô number of information. It might be directly or indirectly, maybe not at all relevant to the question we might ask but based on that information the box will pass us the answer. Now the catch is we will get the answer irrespective of the amount of data given to the box, but the accuracy of the answer depends on the surplus of data.<br>
            Based on this we now can understand how AI can help us in the case of CoVID-19.<br>
            Certain areas include the use of AI which has either helped us tackle this situation, or will in future. Let‚Äôs have a look at some of these areas.</p>
            <h4> Prediction </h4>
        <p class="font1">
            We know that today the best thing we can wish for is to be able to know what's going to happen next. The case of this pandemic is no different. Imagine that there is a way you might predict how good or bad the situation will be after a particular time interval. It gives that much more confidence in how we want to act according to the situation and what we must do to try and change it from its course.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
Here is where the importance of AI in prediction comes into play. Data scientists used different kinds of data from the public surroundings to make sure that any kind of future breakout can be predicted. For eg. data about whether there is an increase in sales of a blanket in a locality is added, this is relevant but even something as meagre as this will tell the machine that there is an increase in common cold and it will consider it as a spike in cases.
Although predictions can go wrong as well, and that's a challenge where the amount of data fed comes in.
        </p>
            <h4> Tracing </h4>
        <p class="font1">
            This domain has an importance of its own as well. Tracing the trails of the disease adds up to the previous domain that we discussed. Tracing how exactly spreads gives us a pattern which again can become a d for another more complex AI which data can help in prediction itself and vice versa. Again policy-making takes tracing very seriously to be more ready than it ever could be. 

        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            Again coin has two sides and this domain is no exception to this rule, although it gives us a great head start for collecting data like this, scientists needed physical surveys and census, which was not something that could be affordable at times like these. So scientists came up with our next domain, let's have a look 

        </p>
            <h4> Contact Tracing </h4>
        <p class="font1">
            Contact tracing is something where instead of tracing the trail on a mammoth level we trace it on the most minuscule level to paint a bigger picture of what the trail might look like. A simple way of explaining this is that, Let's say we have data of a person meeting 3  and then those 3 people meeting 2-3 people each, by this data itself the algorithm can map out the path of infection and contact. In this case, as well as the data about the levels of contact that we add more the picture gets clearer. Fortunately for this kind of data, especially in India apps like Arogya setu, and municipal corporation apps aided in this by tracing the individuals at all times of the day round the clock, to give ample amount of data.

        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            Now the question is what do we do with the prediction and tracing of the virus, the ultimate goal is to prevent or cure the population. Here comes the next domain

        </p>
            <h4> Resource Management </h4>
        <p class="font1">
            So as we discussed earlier the main goal is to be ready for the crisis and manage the resources. Using the data that we collected above can be implemented to make sure that all the resources like meds, pipe kits, hospital beds are available according to the severity in a particular area. The algorithmic machines programmed for this purpose can be used by companies who manage medicines, ppe kits, oxygen cylinders, and more than anyone, the hospitals to manage the inflow of resources where they are needed. For eg. the classic case of the second wave in Delhi, where the situation was dire enough that eventually resources had to be managed from other states where they were less needed.

            
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            These were some technical domains, but AI also asserts its importance in the proper medical field as well. While we know the importance of cures and vaccines, we often undermine the fact that how digital and technologically driven the process of producing these is.
            We have heard all-around how developing vaccines takes time and how it is important to study what effect vaccines have when they interact with animals, and this process when done experimentally might take years to complete is a luxury right now. Hence the scientists decided to use an application of artificial intelligence called simulation, where they used computers and algorithm processors to simulate the interaction of molecules and their effects which saved us a lot of time and enabled the scientists to create history by developing the fastest vaccine ever.
            
            Apart from these, there are some indirect uses as well which although don't help indirectly fighting the virus but help us curb collateral damages to make the direct work easier.
            The social giants like Facebook, Google, Twitter have tweaked their analytical engines so that the AI can differentiate between what fake news is and what is real, this helps in keeping people aware and helps us stop the facade from spreading further.
            Many such uses can be listed out how AI is helping us in tackling the CoVID-19 both directly and indirectly. 
            
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            As discussed earlier the helpfulness is debatable, but to put into perspective as they say in medical science if the benefits outweigh the side effects then the treatment is useful.
            What we have learned from this pandemic is how technology can be useful to save mankind and how we need to reconsider, if we are the supreme beings mother nature has to offer? Can we rely on our intellect to avoid any kind of existential crisis? All these questions are being answered now. We can only hope that next time anything like this comes in front of us, we as a collective human race can fight it together and thrive successfully.
