            In todayâ€™s day and age of data giant companies grossing higher and higher every day, it has become even more interesting to note how this small 4 letter word is affecting both personal as well as the business end of our lives.<br>
            Analysis of this very data and study of this analysis is what has been named as data analytics.
            
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            This science itself has a vast amount of application in todayâ€™s practical life from creating intelligence engines to tracking covid, etc. But business, yes this is a sector which is often eluded from our vision when we pen down where data analytics is important.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            Data analytics have long been seen as a valuable way for businesses to refine their marketing and improve their communication. However, as we learn more about the ways that data can be applied to a business, weâ€™re better understanding the many ways that it can improve business management.
        </p>
        <p class="font1" style="margin: 0;">
            Business when studied at a very surface level has been always seen to be divided into two sectors:
<ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <li>

        Private sector
    </li>
    <li>
        
        Public Sector
    </li>
</ol>
            Data plays an important role in both the public and private sectors. With the ever-evolving collection and analytics tools available, agencies and businesses can use data to streamline workflows, help identify fraud, and much more. 
            
        </p>
        <h3>Applications of Data Analytics        </h3>
        <p class="font1">
            <b>Data analysis</b> in itself as discussed earlier is a huge weapon in this day and age. When we see the dynamics of data analytics with business institutions, we see how the companies can use this to better understand their liabilities and assets. Moreover, the use often comes in understanding the waters of customers and designing their advertisements and campaigns around them. This effective advertisement changes itself and skyrockets any companies repute and profits into a manifold.<br>
            Although data analytics proves its use in every kind of business, let's try to understand what businesses are most susceptible to positive impact by data use.
        </p>
        <ol style="padding-left: 30px;">
            <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <b>Banking</b>: since ancient times banking has been a sector where collection, storage and evaluation of data has been eminent. It's only nowadays that this data analysis system has been digitised and is being used for even more advanced purposes like accounting for some customers, risk management, predicting whether the profit margins between loan interest and saving account interest is going to be enough for the quarter or not, etc
            </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <b>Agriculture</b>: Although this might seem weird data does play a very vital role in the agricultural sector as well.
                Just imagine you have data of produces and losses of crops for let's say 10 years now. So now it becomes easy by analysing that data to know what to do and what not to do for a good crop and good produce, even if not able to increase the product it would at least help us to be ready for a bad year for worst-case scenarios.
            </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <b>Real estate & Property</b>: Again this sector without any doubt exploits the riches of data analytics in the best possible way. Today if we see how the real estate market fluctuates, we will notice that keeping a track of changes and being on our feet can do wonders for us. Thatâ€™s the main reason why many real estate agencies and companies have a high requirement of data analysts in their arsenal.
            </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <b>Telecom</b>: Finally the sector which nowadays is blooming, especially after Indian business giant Mr Mukesh Ambani started his own telecom company. Telecom is the earliest form of digitalization of data. It was the first industry to ever deal in data rather than tangible products. Today telecom companies use data as a weapon to design their plans and services to entice customers into using them. Along with this, there is a small use of data analysis for risk management as well in this particular sector.
            </li>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 10px;">
                <b>Healthcare</b>: Medicine, or the healthcare industry, has always been in dire need of data and its analysis. Just imagine using the data of different kinds of illnesses, patients, drugs and insurances, now if we can harness the data that these provide and work accordingly to improve the services and products, it's only a matter of time before any small healthcare sector company can see booming profits, especially in times like now, when healthcare sector is flourishing more than ever before.
               <br> These were some of the first and foremost sectors using data, but this does not mean that other industries don't have a use for it at all.
                
            </li>
           
        </ol>
        <h3>Use of Data Analytics in Public Sectors</h3>
        <p class="font1">
            The sectors or strata which we discussed above were somehow private sectors, but the government also has its use for data analysis.
From every census to every different government survey. The importance earlier which used to be of recording data, has swiftly moved on to more than recording data, to analysing it and aiding the planning committee to make government schemes and plans.
<br>Similarly public sector companies, even NGOs use this weapon to maximise their reach and profits. We might think about how NGOs might get into this race, but it's just a matter of perspective. 

        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            NGOs need to analyse data that they have to make their motive of work feasible, cause letâ€™s be honest no matter how non-profit or philanthropist a company is, at the end of the day it is a business institution and for a business institution to survive and work properly they need funds as well as right decision-making skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Science in a Nutshell </h3>
        <p class="font1">
            What we have learnt so far is, how far we can go with help of our digital franchises and no matter how evil we deem this generation of computers and AIs, it still finds cracks in our systems and makes itself a necessary evil for our society. 

            
        </p>
        <p class="font1">
            We address this data as evil because as much good it is,  over dependency is always a risk that lingers around us. Early on the amount of mind power which we had developed by remembering and organizing data is now diminishing because we made special software and AIs to handle them, and now instead of data we are concentrating on making those AIs better, so this poses a threat although as discussed data science or data analysis is a necessary evil and its positive effects far outweigh its cons.
